# frontend-mentor-landing-pages

This repository holds challenges from Frontend Mentor. 

1. manage-landing-page-master

This project is a landing page that includes an image slider at the bottom of the page. This image slider is responsive like the rest of the page and displays one slide at a time on mobile with colored bubbles for tracking the slide number. On desktop there are no colored bubbles and slides are displayed on after the other using the regular scroll bar.

2. url-shortening-api-master

This project is a landing page that allows the user to shorten urls. The url shortening is done with an Api, the user is able to copy the url to their clipboard, and their previous searches will remain on the screen as they are being stored on local storage. 
A spinner was added while waiting for the Api to return a response. It has its own scss partial, and was made using plain
CSS animations.
